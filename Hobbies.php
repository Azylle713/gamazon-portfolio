        <h2>Sports</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I consider myself to be a sporty individual, having actively pursued and acquired proficiency in various sports,
             including basketball, badminton, volleyball, and taekwondo. 
             My engagement extends beyond mere experimentation, as I have participated in sports festivals and intramurals across a range of disciplines. 
             This involvement not only showcases my dedication to athletics but also emphasizes my versatility in adapting to different sporting environments.

    <div class="Reading">
        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I have a fondness for reading English novels across various genres, although it's been about five months since I completed a book. 
             A notable fact about me is that I don't enjoy reading online or in e-books; it tends to make me feel sleepy.
              I derive immense satisfaction from reading actual books, relishing the tactile experience of holding a hard copy and even savoring the distinct scent of the pages.
               One of my favorite books that I've read is "It Ends with Us." Despite acknowledging numerous issues with the author, I can't deny her prowess as a great writer.
                The plot of the book is captivating, and I found myself easily hooked into the story.</p>

    <div class="Multimedia">
        <h2>Multimedia</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I possess a deep passion for photography and editing, although I haven't had many opportunities to showcase my skills.
             Despite this, my love for photography remains unwavering. I actively contribute to our church's multimedia and production group,
              where my role primarily involves scriptwriting and coordinating the team. 
              While my responsibilities may not directly involve photography, I am dedicated to ensuring the seamless execution of our group's activities.
               Despite my current focus on scriptwriting and coordination, I am eagerly anticipating future opportunities to actively engage and contribute my photography and editing skills to the group.</p>

    <div class="Writing">
        <h2>Writing</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I have a deep-seated love for writing, and during my time in Senior High School, I used to indulge in crafting poems and stories just for the sheer enjoyment of it.
             I vividly recall a period when I could effortlessly generate three poems in a single day, leaving my teachers and classmates consistently amazed at my ability to conjure words with such speed.
              However, as I've progressed, writing has taken a backseat in my list of priorities. Currently, my primary focus is on learning new things and exploring various facets of myself.
               While writing may not be at the forefront of my activities, the joy it once brought me continues to shape my appreciation for creativity and expression.</p>
